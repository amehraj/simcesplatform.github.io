# Conventions in specification

## Keywords MUST, SHOULD, MAY, REQUIRED, etc.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. See [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)

## Standards in specification
To save in effort in specification and contribute to interoperability, the specification SHOULD use standards where possible. E.g., present datetimes and durations with ISO 8601 rather than any custom format.
