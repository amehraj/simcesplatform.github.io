# Topics (energy)

The following table shows which message type occurs in each topic. If a topic has subtopics, there is a dedicated page for it.

**The table below is normative.** This means that if any other page has a conflicting topic name, this table has the precedence.

In many cases, each message structure only occurs in one topic, but a message structure can be reusable between topics as well. For instance, several topics might deliver forecasts using an identical structure. However, in one topic, you likely expect only one message type.

| Topic | Message type | Purpose; see (1) | Publisher(s) | Subscriber(s) |
|-|-|-|-|-|
