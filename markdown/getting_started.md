# Getting started

## Core and domain

The simulation environment has been split to the following parts:

- **Core**: the sole platform without any domain-specific features
- **Domain**: the domain-specific features built on top of the core
    - i.e., the components of energy system


## Keywords MUST, SHOULD, MAY, REQUIRED, etc.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. See [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)
